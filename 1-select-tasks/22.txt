Create a SQL query to display the name of each customer along with their most expensive purchased product:

| CompanyName | ProductName | PricePerItem |

SELECT DISTINCT [c].[CompanyName],
[p].[ProductName],
[od].[UnitPrice] AS 'PricePerItem'
FROM [Customers] [c]
JOIN [Orders] [o] ON [c].[CustomerId] = [o].[CustomerId]
JOIN [Order Details] [od] ON [od].[OrderId] = [o].[OrderId]
JOIN [Products] [p] ON [od].[ProductId] = [p].[ProductId]
GROUP BY [c].[CompanyName], [p].[ProductName], [od].[UnitPrice]
HAVING [od].[UnitPrice] > ANY
   (SELECT [od2].[UnitPrice]
    FROM [Order Details] [od2]
    GROUP BY [od2].[UnitPrice])
ORDER BY [od].[UnitPrice] DESC;
