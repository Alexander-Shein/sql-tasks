DECLARE @allOrders int
SET @allOrders = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo].[Orders] [o])

SELECT [c].[CustomerID] AS [Customer Id], COUNT([o].[OrderID]) AS [Total number of orders],
COUNT([o].[OrderID])/(CAST(@allOrders AS DECIMAL)) * 100 AS [% all of Orders]
FROM [dbo].[Customers] [c]
JOIN [dbo].[Orders] [o] 
ON [c].[CustomerId] = [o].[CustomerID]
GROUP BY [c].[CustomerID]
ORDER BY [% all of Orders] DESC;
