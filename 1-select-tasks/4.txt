Create a query to return:

| Customer Id | Total number of Orders | % of all orders |
 
order data by % - higher percent at the top.

DECLARE @allOrders int
SET @allOrders = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders o)

SELECT o.CustomerID AS CustomerId,
SUM(o.OrderID)/COUNT(o.OrderID) AS [Total number of Orders],
COUNT(o.OrderID)/(CAST(@allOrders AS DECIMAL))*100 AS [% all of Orders]
FROM dbo.Orders o
GROUP BY o.CustomerID
ORDER BY [% all of Orders] DESC;
