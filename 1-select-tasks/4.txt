Create a query to return:

| Customer Id | Total number of Orders | % of all orders |
 
order data by % - higher percent at the top.

SELECT CustomerID, 
	   COUNT(CustomerID) AS [Total number of Orders], 
	   COUNT(OrderID)*100.0/SUM(COUNT(OrderID)) OVER() AS [% of all orders] 
FROM dbo.Orders 
GROUP BY CustomerID 
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
