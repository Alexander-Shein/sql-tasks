Create a query to return:

| Customer Id | Total number of Orders | % of all orders |
 
order data by % - higher percent at the top.

  SELECT 
	[c].[CustomerID] AS 'Customer Id',
	COUNT([o].[OrderID]) AS [Total number of Orders],
	CAST(COUNT([o].[OrderID])AS decimal(7,4))*100/SUM(COUNT([o].[OrderID])) OVER() AS [% of all orders]
  FROM [dbo].[Customers] [c]
  JOIN [dbo].[Orders] [o] ON [o].[CustomerID]=[c].[CustomerID]
  GROUP BY [c].[CustomerID]
  ORDER BY COUNT([o].[CustomerID]) DESC;
