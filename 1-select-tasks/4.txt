Create a query to return:

| Customer Id | Total number of Orders | % of all orders |
 
order data by % - higher percent at the top.

  SELECT
	[o].[CustomerID] AS 'Customer Id',
	COUNT([o].[OrderID]) AS [Total number of Orders],
	CAST(COUNT([o].[OrderID])AS decimal(7,4))*100/SUM(COUNT([o].[OrderID])) OVER() AS [% of all orders]
  FROM [dbo].[Orders] [o]
  GROUP BY [o].[CustomerID]
  ORDER BY COUNT([o].[CustomerID]) DESC;
