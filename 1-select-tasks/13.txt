Create a SQL query to count current and discontinued products:

| TotalOfCurrentProducts | TotalOfDiscontinuedProducts |

SELECT DISTINCT(SELECT COUNT(Discontinued) 
					   FROM dbo.Products
					   WHERE Discontinued = 0) AS TotalOfCurrentProducts,
	    
				COUNT(Discontinued) AS TotalOfDiscontinuedProducts FROM dbo.Products
	   			WHERE Discontinued = 1
