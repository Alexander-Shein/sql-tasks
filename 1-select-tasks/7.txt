Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.

SELECT [e].[EmployeeId], [e].[FirstName] + ' ' + [e].[LastName] AS 'FullName', ISNULL([eto].[FirstName] + ' ' + [eto].[LastName], '-') AS 'ReporstTo'
FROM [dbo].[Employees] [e]
LEFT JOIN [Employees] [eto] ON [e].[ReportsTo] = [eto].[EmployeeID];
