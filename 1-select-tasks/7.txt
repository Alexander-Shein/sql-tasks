Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.

SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.LastName + ' ' + e.FirstName AS EmploeesFullName, ISNULL(r.LastName + ' ' + r.FirstName, '-') FROM Employees e LEFT JOIN Employees r ON e.ReportsTo = r.EmployeeID;
