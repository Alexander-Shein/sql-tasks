Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.


SELECT e1.EmployeeID, e1.FirstName + ' ' + e1.LastName AS FullName,  ISNULL( e2.FirstName + ' ' + e2.LastName, '-') AS ReportsTo
FROM dbo.Employees e1
LEFT JOIN dbo.Employees e2 ON e1.ReportsTo = e2.EmployeeID
ORDER BY e1.EmployeeID
