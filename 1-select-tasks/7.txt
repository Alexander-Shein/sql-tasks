Create a query to return all employees and full name of person to whom this employee reports to:

| EmployeeId | FullName | ReportsTo |

Full Name - title of courtesy with full name.
Order data by first column.
Reports To - Full name. If the employee does not report to anybody leave "-" in the column.

SELECT [e].[EmployeeID] AS [EmployeeID], [e].[FirstName]+ ' '+[e].[LastName] AS [FullName],
ISNULL([em].[FirstName] + ' '+[em].[LastName],'-') AS [ReportsTo]
FROM [dbo].[Employees] [e]
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Employees] [em] ON [e].[ReportsTo] = [em].[EmployeeID] 
ORDER BY [e].[EmployeeID]
