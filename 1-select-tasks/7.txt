  SELECT 
	[e].[EmployeeID] AS 'EmployeeId',
	[e].[FirstName]+' '+[e].[LastName] AS 'FullName',
	ISNULL([reportsto].[FirstName]+' '+[reportsto].[LastName],'-') AS 'ReportsTo'
  FROM [dbo].[Employees] [e] 
  LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Employees] [reportsto] ON [e].[ReportsTo]=[reportsto].[EmployeeID]
  ORDER BY [e].[EmployeeID];
