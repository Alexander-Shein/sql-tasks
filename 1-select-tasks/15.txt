Create a SQL query to return the total number of orders for every month in 1997 year:

| January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August | September | November | December |

SELECT
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS January,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS February,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS March,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS April,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS May,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS June,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS July,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 8 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS August,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 9 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS September,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS October,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 11 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS November,
	SUM( CASE WHEN MONTH( o.OrderDate )= 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS December
FROM
	dbo.Orders o
WHERE
	YEAR(o.OrderDate)= 1997;
