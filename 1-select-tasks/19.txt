Create a SQL query to display customer details whose total orders amount is more than 10000$:

| CustomerId | CompanyName | TotalOrdersAmount, $ |

SELECT o.CustomerID, c.CompanyName, SUM([od].UnitPrice) AS [TotalOrdersAmount, $]
FROM Customers c 
JOIN Orders o ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN [Order Details] [od] ON [od].OrderID = o.OrderID
GROUP BY o.CustomerID, c.CompanyName
HAVING SUM([od].UnitPrice) > 10000;
