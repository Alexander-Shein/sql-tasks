Create a SQL query to find the employee that sold products for the largest amount:

| EmployeeId | Employee Full Name | Amount, $ |

SELECT TOP 1 e.EmployeeId, e.LastName+' '+e.FirstName AS [Employee Full Name], SUM([od].UnitPrice*[od].Quantity) AS [Amount, $]
FROM dbo.Employees e
JOIN Orders o ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
JOIN dbo.[Order Details] [od] ON o.OrderID = [od].OrderID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId, e.LastName, e.FirstName
ORDER BY [Amount, $] DESC;
