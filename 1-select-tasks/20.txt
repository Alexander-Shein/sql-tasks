Create a SQL query to find the employee that sold products for the largest amount:

| EmployeeId | Employee Full Name | Amount, $ |

SELECT TOP (1) E.EmployeeID, E.FirstName + ' ' + E.LastName AS FullName, SUM(OD.UnitPrice * OD.Quantity) AS [Amount, $]
FROM Northwind.dbo.Employees E
JOIN Northwind.dbo.Orders O ON E.EmployeeID = O.EmployeeID
JOIN Northwind.dbo.[Order Details] OD ON O.OrderID = OD.OrderID
GROUP BY E.EmployeeID, E.FirstName, E.LastName
ORDER BY [Amount, $]
